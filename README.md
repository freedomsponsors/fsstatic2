This will be the new frontend of FreedomSponsors - a mobile first, MaterialDesign-based, SPA.
Separating the front-end and back-end projects will allow for a much faster iteration and lower the technical barriers for contributors.

## Next steps:

* dev-env setup documentation
* javascript tests
* DOCS framework
* mock api's
* component example
* main SPA
* sass and css
